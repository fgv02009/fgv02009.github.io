Technical Lessons From DBC!

10/29/2014

Phase 0 Week 1 has been extremely revealing as to how collaborative the developers' community truly is. This week has been all about learning how git and GitHub work together to allow a community full of creative people (not just developers) to share, cooperate, and learn from one another's projects.

Git is like a local version control software that is downloaded onto your computer and accessed through the command line. Git allows you to save different versions of your work as you go by using commands such as add, status, and commit. The status command allows you to see the changes you've made since the last time you've committed. The add command stages your changes so that they are ready to be committed. The commit command is the actual snapshot and saved version of your changes.

The projects on git and GitHub can vary from poems in Word documents, to pictures in Photoshop, code or even spreadsheet presentations. Git allows you to save different snapshots of your work so that you can always return to an earlier version. So how does git connect to GitHub, you might ask. Great question!

While git lives locally on your computer, GitHub lives remotely on the Internet. GitHub is similar to Dropbox in that you can upload all your projects to GitHub and access them anywhere you are as long as you have Internet access. However, GitHub is much more powerful than dropbox in a number of ways. To begin with, GitHub is an open community unless you choose to make your project private. You can view other people's projects on GitHub, pull their project down onto your local drive - using git - and edit, modify or develop that project in whatever way you would like without messing with the owner's original copy. How is this possible?

If you choose to pull down a project off of GitHub, you will be pulling down a branched off version of the original copy. Thus, the changes you make to the code on your computer will not directly affect the original copy because a new branch of this project has been created. However, if you want these changes to update the master branch, your changes can be pushed back onto GitHub. GitHub allows teams of developers from all over the world to work together on the same project.

Let's say there are three developers working on an application that has three distinct parts that provide different functionalities. You have the starting code which is the master branch uploaded on GitHub. Each developer forks a new branch of this code onto their local drive and makes changes to their own portion of the code. When they are finished, they can ask each other to review their changes and then they can push their code back onto GitHub. The changes made by each one of them are a separate branch off of the master code. To combine all their changes together, git has a powerful tool that allows you to merge the changes that each one of them made into the master file. This command is conveniently named merge.

As you can see git and GitHub are extremely powerful tools when utilized simultaneously. GitHub allows developers to seek help or advice from other developers. It is the ideal place for ideas to flow openly and freely and be seen by numerous people who may have a different way of thinking than the creator. The benefits of such a collaborative environment are endless.
