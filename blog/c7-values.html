            <div id ="content">
                <p>Studies show that self-affirmation tends to minimize the negative effects of stereotype threat. Allowing people to show their self worth by encouraging them to think of skills, characteristics, values or roles that they view as important can eliminate the detrimental impact of stereotype threat. Reminding people of their self-worth is an important part of helping them disregard how they are "stereotypically" supposed to perform. </p>
                <p>When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest or most satisfied the values that come to mind for me are: accomplishment, challenge, close relationships, courage, friendship, helping others, persistence, knowledge and willpower. </p>
                <p>When I'm feeling down and need some self-affirmation to get my confidence back up, I like to remind myself that I'm probably struggling because I value challenging myself. I know that to grow I need to continuously be stepping outside my comfort zone. Typically, when one steps outside their comfort zone, they feel incredibly lost and confused before they feel confident. Not to mention, trying new things often ends in failure before it ends in success. However, it's important to me that I continue to challenge myself in all of the aspects of my life. I know that I will only feel happy in a career that will continue to push me and teach me new things day in and day out. I also try to challenge myself in my relationships. Being a good person inside your relationships involves a lot of self reflection. It involves truly understanding what relationships have positive impacts on your life and knowing when to let go of relationship that are no longer healthy for you.</p>
                <p>While I have promised not to let the stereotype threat of being a girl in coding impact my performance at DBC, at least now I have a way to do that. If I start to feel down I can think about characteristics that I highly values and that have led me to accomplishments and happiness in my past.</p>
