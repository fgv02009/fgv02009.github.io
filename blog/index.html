			  <p> Phase 0 Week 1 has been extremely revealing as to how collaborative the developers' community truly is. This week has been all about learning how git and GitHub work together to allow a community full of creative people (not just developers) to share, cooperate, and learn from one another's projects.</p> <a href = "t1-git-blog.html"> Read More... </a>
			  <h3>Lessons From Fireside Chat with Shereef </h3>
			  <p> Without having started on site at DBC, it is hard to really understand what kind of environment you are going to be thrown into. Last week, as Phase 0 approached and the google+ group had been set up, I could already feel the excitement of my fellow peers. Everyone is anxious to dive in and learn together. Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat made me realize that DBC's interviews are used as a screening process to intentionally find these types of people. I am confident that when Phase 1 begins, I will be surrounded by curious, nervous, excited and engaging people that will make this experience an unforgettable one. </p> <a href = "c1-chefs-kitchen.html"> Read More... </a>

			  <h3>Fixed, Relative and Absolute Positioning in CSS</h3>
			  <p> Positioning elements on a webpage can be more confusing than you think. You may think, "this page would look better if I could just move that picture to the left a little bit." So you provide the picture a little padding-left but it doesn't respond the way you think it would. The way an element responds to positioning commands completely depends on the type of positioning it has been assigned. I will attempt to shed some light on this concept.</p> <a href = "t2-css-design.html"> Read More... </a>

        <h3>Thinking Styles</h3>
        <p> People are wired a certain way. In college, when I was often required to work in groups for projects or assignments, it became very clear to me that what works for some people is often the farthest thing from what works for others. For some people, just being in a group was enough to cause them anxiety. Others thrived in group settings by leading discussions and directing the flow of the project. Some seemed confused by the professor's teaching methods but for others, he could not be more coherent.</p> <a href = "c3_thinking-style.html"> Read More... </a>
        <h3>Storing Data vs. Ordered Data</h3>
        <p>Array: ordered, integer-indexed collection of any object.</p>
        <p>Hash: dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values.</p>
        <p>What the heck does that mean? Think of an array as a music player that just holds song titles (let's call this array music_player_array). Each song is specified by its index. Arrays begin their index at 0. Thus, the first song in your music holder can be accessed by typing music_player_array[0]. Wouldn't it be more convenient though if we could access the song by identifying the artist instead of having to memorize the order of the songs. Luckily for us, hashes have that capability. While hashes are very similar to arrays, they differ in that the indexing is done using arbitrary keys. So now we can think of a hash (let's call it music_player_hash) as a music player that stores the artist and the song title. Now since the order of the songs doesn't really give us any information about the song (unless we've memorized the order or index) we can instead access the song by passing the hash its key--or in this case the artist. Therefore, as an example, we could type music_player_hash ["lady gaga"] and it would return "Bad Romance."</p>

        <h3>Where Are All The Women?</h3>
        <p> The tech industry is facing a grave diversity problem. It is not just a wall that keeps females and minorities out (or gives them limited access) but also a ceiling that keeps them from rising to the top. This is a problem that has been seen in many other industries such as finance and engineering, but it permeates the technology industry so deeply that that the discussion has become ubiquitous. Being a hispanic female and novice to the tech industry, these problems cause serious and relevant concerns for me.</p> <a href = "c4-tech-issues.html"> Read More... </a>
        <h3>.group_by </h3>
        <p>The enumerable module provides a number of methods that are used to traverse, sort, arrange and rearrange collections. These methods have proven EXTREMELY useful as I've made my way through Phase 0. The method I'm going to teach  is a method called .group_by.</p>

        <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
        <p> While pairing has innumerable benefits, it can also be emotionally challenging. You have to be open to give actionable, specific and kind feedback, but even harder than that, you have to be willing to receive that feedback from your partner and turn it into visible improvements in your coding style. I try really hard to focus on suggestions made by my pairs in the past as I pair moving forward, but sometimes it is easier said than done. The way each of us behaves in a pairing session is a product of the way we are most comfortable communicating and our own problem solving process. Changing what has become habit is hard to do, but it is important to try to incorporate your pairs feedback as you move forward as a developer.</p> <a href = "c5-feedback.html"> Read More... </a>
        <h3> Classes </h3>
        <p>This week was all about creating and understanding classes in Ruby. I'm going to attempt to pass off some of my recently acquired knowledge on this topic to you.</p>

        <h3>"It's a Man's Field"</h3>
        <p> Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. There are many studies that document this effect. For example, a 1995 study showed that Black college freshman and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. However, when race was not emphasized, Black students performed at the same level or better than their fellow White students. The effects of stereotype threat can go far past educational outcome, and can even impact educational pursuits. It can deter women from joining STEM fields and white men from playing sports. As a woman who has pursued math, economics, finance and now computer programming, I would be crazy to say that the stereotype of women (or lack thereof) in these fields has not had an impact on my self confidence.</p> <a href = "c6-stereotype-threat.html"> Read More... </a>
        <h3> Classes vs. Modules </h3>
        <p>Modules and classes are similar in a number of ways but it's important to understand how and why they differ. Let's start at the beginning. Creating a module is done the exact same way as creating a class except with the keyword module. i.e.</p>

        <h3>Love Yourself</h3>
        <p> Studies show that self-affirmation tends to minimize the negative effects of stereotype threat. Allowing people to show their self worth by encouraging them to think of skills, characteristics, values or roles that they view as important can eliminate the detrimental impact of stereotype threat. Reminding people of their self-worth is an important part of helping them disregard how they are "stereotypically" supposed to perform. </p> <a href = "c7-values.html"> Read More... </a>
        <h3> Learning New Languages </h3>
        <p>This week at DBC has been all about learning a new language, JavaScript. It is most commonly used as a part of a web browser. It allows your code to interact with the user and it can alter the content that is being displayed on a webpage. In a lot of ways knowing the language Ruby has helped me learn JavaScript. I know what variables and loops are and I am starting to understand the power of programming languages. However, Ruby and JavaScript are very different. Sometimes knowing one, complicates the way you "speak" in another. It reminds me of the time I took Italian in college. I was already fluent in Spanish and that made it pretty easy for me to read Italian, but when I tried to speak Italian I was often confusing the two languages with each other. So what's so different about these two languages, you might ask.</p>

        <h3>Growing From Adversity</h3>
        <p> The conflict I am going to tell you about is one from when I was in 6th grade. Sounds a bit outdated, you might say. Yes, it is. But I think it is a good example that will illustrate how dealing with conflict has been a learning process for me and how I've grown to be a much more forward person. </p> <a href = "c8-conflict.html"> Read More... </a>
        <h3> What is Rails? </h3>
        <p>Since we're getting close to phase 1 and we haven't discussed Rails yet, I figured I'd do some research and share what I found. Rails is an open source web application framework that is written in Ruby. It is a full-stack framework, meaning it helps you fully develop all aspects of the application from the user interface to the data storage. Rails emphasizes the use of well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration, don't repeat yourself, the active record pattern and model-view-controller.</p>

        <h3>How to Ask Questions</h3>
        <p> As a novice to the technology and programming fields, unknown answers are part of my everyday struggle. While working on assignments all week long, dozens of questions pop into my head. Usually I struggle with them on my own and resort to google to help me solve them. I would say about 90% of the time either I am able to figure out the solution on my own or google leads me to someone who has already answered this question for someone else. What happens the other 10% of the time? </p> <a href = "c9-questions.html"> Read More... </a>
