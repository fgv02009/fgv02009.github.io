			  	<p> Phase 0 Week 1 has been extremely revealing as to how collaborative the developers' community truly is. This week has been all about learning how git and GitHub work together to allow a community full of creative people (not just developers) to share, cooperate, and learn from one another's projects.</p> <a href = "t1-git-blog.html"> Read More... </a>
			  	<h3>Lessons From Fireside Chat with Shereef </h3>
			  	<p> Without having started on site at DBC, it is hard to really understand what kind of environment you are going to be thrown into. Last week, as Phase 0 approached and the google+ group had been set up, I could already feel the excitement of my fellow peers. Everyone is anxious to dive in and learn together. Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat made me realize that DBC's interviews are used as a screening process to intentionally find these types of people. I am confident that when Phase 1 begins, I will be surrounded by curious, nervous, excited and engaging people that will make this experience an unforgettable one. </p> <a href = "c1-chefs-kitchen.html"> Read More... </a>

			  	<p> Positioning elements on a webpage can be more confusing than you think. You may think, "this page would look better if I could just move that picture to the left a little bit." So you provide the picture a little padding-left but it doesn't respond the way you think it would. The way an element responds to positioning commands completely depends on the type of positioning it has been assigned. I will attempt to shed some light on this concept. </p> <a href = "t2-css-design.html"> Read More... </a>
