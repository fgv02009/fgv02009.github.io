			  	<p> Phase 0 Week 1 has been extremely revealing as to how collaborative the developers' community truly is. This week has been all about learning how git and GitHub work together to allow a community full of creative people (not just developers) to share, cooperate, and learn from one another's projects.</p> <a href = "t1-git-blog.html"> Read More... </a>
			  	<h3>Lessons From Fireside Chat with Shereef </h3>
			  	<p> Without having started on site at DBC, it is hard to really understand what kind of environment you are going to be thrown into. Last week, as Phase 0 approached and the google+ group had been set up, I could already feel the excitement of my fellow peers. Everyone is anxious to dive in and learn together. Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat made me realize that DBC's interviews are used as a screening process to intentionally find these types of people. I am confident that when Phase 1 begins, I will be surrounded by curious, nervous, excited and engaging people that will make this experience an unforgettable one. </p> <a href = "c1-chefs-kitchen.html"> Read More... </a>

			  	<h3>Fixed, Relative and Absolute Positioning in CSS</h3>
			  	<p> Positioning elements on a webpage can be more confusing than you think. You may think, "this page would look better if I could just move that picture to the left a little bit." So you provide the picture a little padding-left but it doesn't respond the way you think it would. The way an element responds to positioning commands completely depends on the type of positioning it has been assigned. I will attempt to shed some light on this concept. </p> <a href = "t2-css-design.html"> Read More... </a>

          <h3>Thinking Styles</h3>
          <p> People are wired a certain way. In college, when I was often required to work in groups for projects or assignments, it became very clear to me that what works for some people is often the farthest thing from what works for others. For some people, just being in a group was enough to cause them anxiety. Others thrived in group settings by leading discussions and directing the flow of the project. Some seemed confused by the professor's teaching methods but for others, he could not be more coherent.</p> <a href = "c3_thinking-style.html"> Read More... </a>
          <h3>Storing Data vs. Ordered Data</h3>
          <p>Array: ordered, integer-indexed collection of any object.</p>
          <p>Hash: dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values.</p>
          <p>What the heck does that mean? Think of an array as a music player that just holds song titles (let's call this array music_player_array). Each song is specified by its index. Arrays begin their index at 0. Thus, the first song in your music holder can be accessed by typing music_player_array[0]. Wouldn't it be more convenient though if we could access the song by identifying the artist instead of having to memorize the order of the songs. Luckily for us, hashes have that capability. While hashes are very similar to arrays, they differ in that the indexing is done using arbitrary keys. So now we can think of a hash (let's call it music_player_hash) as a music player that stores the artist and the song title. Now since the order of the songs doesn't really give us any information about the song (unless we've memorized the order or index) we can instead access the song by passing the hash its key--or in this case the artist. Therefore, as an example, we could type music_player_hash ["lady gaga"] and it would return "Bad Romance."</p>

          <h3>Where Are All The Women?</h3>
          <p> The tech industry is facing a grave diversity problem. It is not just a wall that keeps females and minorities out (or gives them limited access) but also a ceiling that keeps them from rising to the top. This is a problem that has been seen in many other industries such as finance and engineering, but it permeates the technology industry so deeply that that the discussion has become ubiquitous. Being a hispanic female and novice to the tech industry, these problems cause serious and relevant concerns for me.</p> <a href = "c4-tech-issues.html"> Read More... </a>
          <h3>.group_by </h3>
          <p>The enumerable module provides a number of methods that are used to traverse, sort, arrange and rearrange collections. These methods have proven EXTREMELY useful as I've made my way through Phase 0. The method I'm going to teach  is a method called .group_by.</p>

          <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
          <p> While pairing has innumerable benefits, it can also be emotionally challenging. You have to be open to give actionable, specific and kind feedback, but even harder than that, you have to be willing to receive that feedback from your partner and turn it into visible improvements in your coding style. I try really hard to focus on suggestions made by my pairs in the past as I pair moving forward, but sometimes it is easier said than done. The way each of us behaves in a pairing session is a product of the way we are most comfortable communicating and our own problem solving process. Changing what has become habit is hard to do, but it is important to try to incorporate your pairs feedback as you move forward as a developer.</p> <a href = "c5-feedback.html"> Read More... </a>
          <h3> Classes </h3>
          <p>This week was all about creating and understanding classes in Ruby. I'm going to attempt to pass off some of my recently acquired knowledge on this topic to you.</p>
