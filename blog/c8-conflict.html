                <p>The conflict I am going to tell you about is one from when I was in 6th grade. Sounds a bit outdated, you might say. Yes, it is. But I think it is a good example that will illustrate how dealing with conflict has been a learning process for me and how I've grown to be a much more forward person. </p>
                <p>6th grade is like a jungle... Children are mean, easily persuaded and, no offense, but usually too inexperienced to make judgement calls for themselves and instead just follow the pack. When I was in 6th grade, I had a close group of girlfriends (a "clique") and I had an argument with one of the girls. I didn't really think it was a big deal, we were in 6th grade, for all I know we were probably fighting over which Backstreet Boy was our boyfriend. Anyways, this girl went and told another girl, let's call her Katie, about our argument. Katie was the type of girl people listened to. Everyone wanted to be her friend, but in order to be her friend, you had to be on her side no matter what you really believed. Katie was appalled by the story she heard and decided that I no longer deserved friends. By the power vested in Katie, and the stupidity of all 6th graders willing to blindly follow an evil tyrant, she managed to ruin that year of my life.</p>
                <p>Ruin might seem like a harsh word, and in retrospect, it is too harsh. I am no longer friends with any of those girls, but I don't think it is because of that year. We were so different we would have fallen apart anyways. However, that was the first year in my life I felt what it was like to be an outcast. One time at lunch, she got the whole table to chant "Roses are red, bats are black, go to Argentina and never come back" (I am from Argentina). Every day, for the remainder of 6th grade, I came home crying. I met with a counselor for the first time that year because as a child, I truly felt like my world was crumbling around me. I had lost all my friends in my elementary school, and even if people in my class did like me, they were too afraid to show it because they didn't want Katie to dislike them. I wanted to switch schools, and my parents almost let me. Then they decided I was only about a semester away from middle school where I would be reunited with a lot of other friends that I had from playing sports. I was so mad at them...How could they force me to stay here? I was miserable.</p>
                <p>Here I am, about 12 years later and I'm thankful my parents made me stick it out. That year was extremely hard for me and I was too afraid to stick up for myself and I cared way too much about what other people thought about me. Today, I can happily say that while I don't like confrontation, I am not one who holds things in. When things are bothering me, I like to get them out in the open as soon as possible. I know, from experience, that holding things in can tear you up inside. Not to mention, when you leave high school you start to learn who your true friends are. You find a small number of people that you would do just about anything for and then you realize you only care what they think. I've come to learn that you can't make everyone like you, and to not take it personally when they don't. Their loss anyways.</p>
