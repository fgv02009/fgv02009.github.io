            <h3 class="blog-post-subtitle"> The Tech Industry's Biggest Problem </h3>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">11/11/2014  by <a href="blog-nav-item active" href="../index.html">Flori</a></p>

            <p>The tech industry is facing a grave diversity problem. It is not just a wall that keeps females and minorities out (or gives them limited access) but also a ceiling that keeps them from rising to the top. This is a problem that has been seen in many other industries such as finance and engineering, but it permeates the technology industry so deeply that that the discussion has become ubiquitous. Being a hispanic female and novice to the tech industry, these problems cause serious and relevant concerns for me.</p>
            <p>Let's look at Google's most recent diversity numbers: 30% of their worldwide staff are women, 17% of their technical staff are women, 61% are white, 30% are Asian, 3% are Hispanic, and 2% are African-American. Don't think for a second, that Google is alone in this relatively homogeneous make up of employees. Twitter, Yahoo, LinkedIn and Facebook share similar issues. While race is clearly a problem, I've chosen to reflect more deeply on the gender inequality plaguing the technology industry.</p>
            <p>While some blame schools and society for not encouraging women into STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, others feel that it has more to do with the culture being fostered within the industry. It has gotten to the point where the tech field has even been described as misogynistic. I personally believe that a little bit of both of these factors are to blame. Given that I am new to the field, I don't have first hand experience of these cultures in action; however, I have gone to high school and college and witnessed the male domination of these classes. It may be an issue that is embedded in society but it may also have to do with the way education presents coding. "A 2009 study tested various messages about computer science with college-bound teens. It found that explaining how programming skills can be used to 'do good' --connect with one's community, make a difference on big social problems like pollution and health care --reverberated strongly with girls. Far less successful were messages about getting a good job or being 'in the driver's seat' of technological innovation --i.e., the dominant cultural narratives about why anyone would learn to code." When it comes to education, it is clear that this is where the change must begin; the number of women in tech will never improve if the number of females applying to these positions never improves. However, that is only the beginning. For women to want to be part of this experience, they have to feel comfortable and safe, which is shockingly something many women are saying they don't feel.</p>
            <p>Like I mentioned above, I don't have first hand experience with the female bullying that seems to be becoming the norm in this industry, but I have read about plenty of examples. As feminist have begun to stand up against the depiction of women in video games, they are being harassed and threatened by immature male gamers. Anita Sarkeesian, the culture critic whose website is devoted to deconstructing the ways in which many video game reinforce negative, usually sexual, stereotypes about women was supposed to give a speech at Utah State but was forced to cancel because of a mass-shooting threat. The New York Times published an article depicting Elissa Shevinsky's struggle as a female in the tech industry. She started an app with a man she deeply respected and was let down by the sexist public image he portrayed. She ended up leaving the project but he asked her to come back and she helped him realize that he had to change his ways or she would not work with him. Ms. Shevinsky decided she would try to change the culture from the inside.</p>
            <p>So how can we possibly change this environment? I believe that the first key is to increase the number of women being educated in these fields. It needs to start in the school systems and at a young age. However, the culture of the field needs to be changed by the men and women already in the field. Women need to stand up when there is an injustice and, more importantly, men need to support these women. Companies benefit from diversity because the consumers of their products are a diverse group of people. Women know what women like. If there is not a single woman at a company, how can you be sure that you are tailoring your product to women? More importantly, everyone should feel comfortable, safe, and respected in the work place, no matter gender, race or age. </p>
