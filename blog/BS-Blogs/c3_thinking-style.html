            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Thinking Styles</h2>
            <h3 class="blog-post-subtitle"> Adapting The Way We Learn </h3>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">11/11/2014  by <a href="blog-nav-item active" href="../index.html">Flori</a></p>

            <p>People are wired a certain way. In college, when I was often required to work in groups for projects or assignments, it became very clear to me that what works for some people is often the farthest thing from what works for others. For some people, just being in a group was enough to cause them anxiety. Others thrived in group settings by leading discussions and directing the flow of the project. Some seemed confused by the professor's teaching methods but for others, he could not be more coherent. </p>
            <p>I had faith in all my classmates and knew they were all very intelligent, but I often wondered why some thrived in certain situations and others (myself included) were stunted by the methods certain professors used. When I started reading about the Gregorc Thinking Style (named after Anthony Gregorc), it clicked. Often times the material we need to learn is not presented to us in the style that best fits our method of thinking. In these cases, if students are not able to adapt either themselves to a new form of learning, or the material into a new form of presentation, then they may fall behind. </p>
            <p>Gregorc describes two perceptual qualities: concrete and abstract. People with concrete qualities register information directly from their five senses, they are dealing with the obvious and not looking for hidden meaning. People with the abstract quality are able to visualize and conceive ideas. These people look beyond what is obvious and can use their imagination and intuition to see beyond what is right in front of them. He also describes two ordering qualities: sequential and random. Those with the ability to order sequentially organize information in a linear and logical manner, whereas those with the ability to order randomly, organize their information in chunks, but in no particular order. These people can often skip steps in a process and still end up with the desired results. Gregorc uses these four qualities/abilities to come up with the four strongest perceptual and ordering abilities found in each individual: concrete sequential, abstract random, abstract sequential and concrete random.</p>
            <p>I recently took the personal style thinking test and received my highest score in the concrete random section, and while I think a lot of the characteristics of a concrete random thinker are fitting for me, I don't agree with all of them. (Then again, Gregorc does say no one is a "pure" style, but a combination of the four styles.) My scores were very close all across the board and I think it is because as I've grown up my thinking method has changed, it has been molded by many different learning experiences.</p>
            <p>As a child I wanted to work by myself, I wanted directions and rules and only one right answer. I was all about getting the best grade, and the most conducive way for me to do that was when there were directions to follow and no one in my way preventing me from being efficient. </p>
            <p>Thankfully, I went to college. Pomona college, and many liberal arts colleges in general, pride themselves on teaching their students how to learn. My learning horizon expanded exponentially while I was at Pomona. I was often forced to work in groups and by the second or third year I actually preferred that to working alone. While there was still a decent amount of structure in my courses, professors weren't necessarily impressed by the student that got the highest grade in their class. They wanted students that were inquisitive and asked interesting questions and didn't just finish the homework and follow the formulas. I like to think that my time at Pomona slowly started to shape me into a more flexible learner. It is possible that I went from being a highly concrete sequential learner to a mix of any of the other three during my time in college.</p>
            <p>Since phase 0 has started, I find myself wishing I had more access to other students or staff. While I am very efficient working alone, often times I crave the group setting. It's not necessarily because I have a ton of questions (although sometimes I do), but it's because I've always learned more by being in a group and hearing other people ask questions</p>
            <p>I know that to get the most of DBC I need to be a flexible learner. I need to be open to the idea of being intently focused one minute and off on a tangent the next. While intense focus helps with efficiency, it is often the students that allow their brains to wander off the specified path for a bit that get the most from their experiences. This will be the first time that I will be going to school where I am not evaluated by grades, but truly by my ability to understand and implement certain concepts. I know that to fully capture everything DBC has to offer, I have to step up to the challenge of accessing all four thinking styles.</p>
