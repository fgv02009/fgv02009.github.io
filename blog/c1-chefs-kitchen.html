            <p>Without having started on site at DBC, it is hard to really understand what kind of environment you are going to be thrown into. Last week, as Phase 0 approached and the google+ group had been set up, I could already feel the excitement of my fellow peers. Everyone is anxious to dive in and learn together. Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat made me realize that DBC's interviews are used as a screening process to intentionally find these types of people. I am confident that when Phase 1 begins, I will be surrounded by curious, nervous, excited and engaging people that will make this experience an unforgettable one.</p>
            <p>I'm only 3 days into Phase 0 Week 1 and the DBC culture is already starting to shine through. The google+ community is extremely active, with students of cohorts in all three locations coming together to answer other students' questions. In my intro session, I met six of my other cohort members, each with extremely unique and interesting backgrounds. Every person I've spoken to, whether it be a teacher or a student is extremely excited about this process.</p>
            <p>While I am nervous about the intense schedule Phase 1 entails, the culture of DBC is what I think will pull me through it. The environment differs from a normal school in that it is supportive, creative and experimental as opposed to competitive, by-the-books, and based on test scores. DBC seems like a place that collects individuals with strengths all over the board; so while one day you may be learning from your peers, the next day you may be teaching your peers. Before even arriving on campus, my cohort is starting to feel like a community that I can reach out to. Shereef made it clear that when we walk into Phase 1, we should all feel like we are in this together and we all bring something unique to the table. We can not have a consumer mindset, we must have a creative mindset. We are not here to just make it through the curriculum - consume it, if you will. We are here to surprise ourselves, our teachers and our classmates with the amount that we can learn.</p>
            <p>The Fireside Chat made me realize that the concerns and insecurities I'm having about my coding abilities are certainly shared with the remainder of my cohort. This video made it clear that most of us come in with very little knowledge about the world of a professional developer; but with hard work we can finish Phase 1 of Dev Bootcamp in nine weeks and blow your mind with the amount of progress we've made.</p>
