                <p>Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. There are many studies that document this effect. For example, a 1995 study showed that Black college freshman and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. However, when race was not emphasized, Black students performed at the same level or better than their fellow White students. The effects of stereotype threat can go far past educational outcome, and can even impact educational pursuits. It can deter women from joining STEM fields and white men from playing sports. As a woman who has pursued math, economics, finance and now computer programming, I would be crazy to say that the stereotype of women (or lack thereof) in these fields has not had an impact on my self confidence.
                </p>
                <p>As a child, I loved math and I was too young to really understand that math was stereotypically for men. Besides, I was quite a tomboy as a child so I probably would have liked it if you told me math was meant for men and women aren't as good at it. I would have felt like I was doing something that only men were supposed to be doing, and I would have felt empowered by that. As time passed though, and I struggled in more challenging math classes in college that were filled mainly with men, I began to think maybe I really didn't belong. Maybe there was something genetically different between men and women that made math easier for men. I know this isn't really true, and even though I struggled I did well in my math and economics classes in college. In retrospect, it makes sense that the people doing the best in those classes were men given that 80% of the class was men. By the end of college I had recovered from the stereotype threat and I was feeling confident again in my skills...and then I took a job doing financial consulting.
                </p>
                <p>As I started out in the real world, I jumped into a restructuring consultant job with a background in math and economics and maybe two accounting courses. I was one of two women on my team of 15, and again, my confidence was shaken. I knew I didn't know nearly as much about finance as my peers but shortly after starting I realized, that was ok. My team was supportive and interested in teaching me and getting me to the place I needed to be to start my career off on the right foot. During my time as a restructuring consultant, I realized that the answer to overcoming the stereotype threat as a women is to be surrounded by people who don't treat you as if you're handicapped because of your gender or race. I was treated with respect and quickly realized that I had the tools to learn quickly and as new college graduate, male or female, that is all my team was asking of me.</p>
                <p>During my short tenure in finance, I again struggled with, but overcame, the stereotype threat. I am now entering into the developers' world and the same stereotype exist. However, I am determined not to be discouraged by the meager population of women in this field. "This is a man's field" will no longer be a detrimental phrase to my performance. If anything I need to take a lesson from my childhoods self and be excited by the challenge to change the stereotype and not deterred by the stereotype itself. </p>
                <p>The best advice I can offer someone struggling with the pernicious effects of stereotype threat, is to remember that you are in control. DBC enforces the idea of a growth mindset because it is the truth. Intelligence is malleable and your attitude and willingness to grow and learn will be the only thing that can hold you back, not your race or your gender. </p>
