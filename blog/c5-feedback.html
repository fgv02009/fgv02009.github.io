                <p>Pairing on challenges with members of my cohort has been an overall enjoyable and informative experience. My pair often brings with him/her a skill set that is different from mine. Sometimes the technical level differs, sometimes the pairing technique differs, and sometimes it's a completely different way of problem solving. In any case, having a pair work with you on a project opens up a door to an array of tools that you would have otherwise been without.</p>
                <p>While pairing has innumerable benefits, it can also be emotionally challenging. You have to be open to give actionable, specific and kind feedback, but even harder than that, you have to be willing to receive that feedback from your partner and turn it into visible improvements in your coding style. I try really hard to focus on suggestions made by my pairs in the past as I pair moving forward, but sometimes it is easier said than done. The way each of us behaves in a pairing session is a product of the way we are most comfortable communicating and our own problem solving process. Changing what has become habit is hard to do, but it is important to try to incorporate your pairs feedback as you move forward as a developer. </p>
                <p>I've had a number of experiences during peer pairing, although I can't say any of them have been frustrating...yet. So far most of my experiences have been positive and I feel like I've grown by working with my peers. Often when I don't know exactly how to solve a problem, I tell my pair I'm jotting some thoughts down on a piece of paper in order to try and come up with a logical plan. I don't feel comfortable spewing out my half developed ideas to my pair until they are a little more pulled together. I often get feedback that my pair wishes I would talk out loud while I am doing this so that when I do form the thoughts into code, they know where I am going. This has been the hardest challenge for me. I often find that when I talk out loud during this process, my thoughts don't come out coherently and I end up confusing my pair. I think the key to solving this problem is to take just enough time to myself to come up with a direct way to tell my pair what I'm thinking. It is somewhere in between the previous two extremes. I want to be able to directly communicate my train of thought even though I haven't arrived at the destination.</p>
                <p>Receiving and incorporating feedback is challenging, but providing feedback has its difficulties as well. Like I said, I haven't had any truly frustrating pairing sessions and therefore, I haven't had to give particularly difficult feedback. However, it is challenging to give feedback that is simultaneously kind, on the one hand, and honest and constructive, on the other. You want your pair to learn and grow from your feedback but you don't want to offend your pair and create a hostile pairing environment.

                <p>DBC's curriculum is heavily grounded in peer pairing and the benefits that come from it. For it to be fully effective, the pairs need to be open to giving and receiving feedback even when it is hard to do. Pair programming is becoming more mainstream in the developer's world so it is important to graduate from DBC as a communicative and cooperative person. </p>
