        <p> Pair programming is a collaborative coding experience used to tackle a coding challenge.
        One of the key elements of pair programming is driving and navigating, which will be discussed below
        in greater detail.
        </p>
        <p> Pair programming is a common practice in the coding field. DBC uses it to prepare
        its students for a career in programming after graduation. It allows each student to learn
        from his or her peers by working through challenges together.
        </p>
        <p> Everyones idea of driving and navigating is different. You and your pair can
            discuss your preferences when it comes to driving and navigating. Once you are assigned
            as the driver, you will be the person writing the code into a text editor and running it
            through your terminal. As the navigator, you will control the flow of the process by
            telling your driver where to go.
            Sometimes you and your pair want to be explicit about who is driving and who is navigating.
            However, there are cases when the challenge you are facing will be better solved by
            more seemless switching.

            My pair and I worked well together to create our website. We decided to stay pretty basic in our design to get as much done in the hour the guide was on. We did a good job of switching back and forth between the driving and navigating positions. We had some issues with our positioning in CSS but we were able to try a few things out and pick the one we felt worked the best for our site.
