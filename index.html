        <div class = "txt">
          <p>After graduating from Pomona College, I took a job working for FTI Consulting in the Corporate Finance/Restructuring group based in Chicago. During my time at FTI, I worked on a variety of cases mostly helping my team with analysis used to advise distressed companies. (Check out my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pub/florencia-garcia-vicente/44/523/652/">linkedin</a> for more details.)</p>
          <p> I left FTI at the end of October to start at Dev Bootcamp. At Dev Bootcamp I am learning Ruby on Rails, html, css, javascript, git and source control. I am very excited to start pursuing my career as a developer. </p>

        <div class = "headline"> Interests </div>
        <div class = "txt">
          <p> Outside of programming and finance, I am passionate about behavioral economics and urban and regional economics. I am currently in the process of editing and submitting my senior thesis "A Long-Run View of IT Clustering in the American Market" to a peer-reviewed journal.<p>
          <p> I also love to play and watch sports. I grew up playing soccer, basketball and gymnastics and I love to play pickup games and stay active. I also love to read! Some of my favorite books include: Into Thin Air, Unbroken, Devil in the White City, Outliars and The Racketeer. Finally, I'm very passionate about traveling. I want to see as much of the world as I possibly can. </p>
